## Background

In this assignment, I buil an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Data Visualization Dashboard

Using the provided dashboard HTML template, the first step was to populate a click button for each test subject. Each subject would be identified by a unique ID that could be accessed from a dropdown menu. Beneath the dropdown menu, a demographic info chart would populate for the selected subject.
